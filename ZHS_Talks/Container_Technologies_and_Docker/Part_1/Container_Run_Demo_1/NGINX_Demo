--> Run NGINX container:

  docker container run -P -d nginx

    (If there is no nginx image, firstly will pull from the Dockerhub then container will run.)

    ""-d= If we want to run this container in background and work some command in it.
    "" -P= In this situation, this flag will map it to all reports to a random port number. (Dont needed actually.)
           Used to publish all exposed ports to random ports.

    *** If we want to specify port number, we need to use "HOST_PORT" and "CONTAINER_PORT".


    *** If we just run this docker command without any flag, we will just stuck in the command prompt because container still running in foreground.

    docker container run nginx

--> See more about container:

  docker inspect $CONTAINER_ID "OR" $CONTAINER_NAME


--> We can attach container for STDOUT with this command.

  docker attach $CONTAINER_ID "OR" $CONTAINER_NAME


--> With "docker attach" we will see nothing because there is no traffic. So, go and make traffic with "curl" in another tab.
    Then go back to the attach tab.


(We can find the $PRIVATE_IP_THAT_FOUND_WITH_INSPECT for container with "docker inspect" command in "NetworkSettings" section which is part of the output.)

  curl http://$PRIVATE_IP_THAT_FOUND_WITH_INSPECT

 --> We can run specific command in a container with this command.
     For example, /bin/bash. With these, we will get the prompt of container.

    (-it= “I” for interractive.Attach container’s STDIN and “t” for stands for TTY. Allocate a pseudo-TTY)


  docker container exec -it $CONTAINER_ID "OR" $CONTAINER_NAME /bin/bash


    (For NGINX, in the “/usr/share/nginx/html/” directory, we have default html files.)
    (Also, the “index.html” file is the our default NGINX home page.)
